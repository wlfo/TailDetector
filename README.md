# TailDetector

The **TailDetector** is an automotive system for surveillance detecting. 

The system consists of three major components:
* Four [Cameras](#cameras) installed inside a vehicle (one front camera and three other on the back of the vehicle).
* A [Single Board Computer](#single-board-computer) with high GPU capabilities enabling complex AI operations for automated license plate recognition.
* An [Ios Application](#ios-application) to draw "detection routes", control the single-board computer and to get alerts in case of detected surveillance ("Tails").


## Cameras
I am using Basler dart cameras with USB 3.0 interface. USB 3.0 interface offers a volume of bandwidth suitable for this scenario (350 MB/s). There is also plug-and-play compatibility and reliable USB3 Vision industrial standard. USB 3.0 offers highly reliable data transfer between host and device and integrated (buffer) memory for top stability in industrial applications. It also support cable length up to 8m.
