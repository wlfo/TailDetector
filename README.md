# TailDetector

The **TailDetector** is an automotive system for surveillance detection. It was developed as a **Proof of Concept** for using a computer vision system to detect possible vehicle surveillance. Money delivery trucks, for example, can use TailDetector to detect hostile vehicles that are trying to gather information about their delivery routine. To maximize the probability of accurate detection and to reduce false positives, the **SDR** (Surveillance Detection Route) must be drawn wisely. Information about some practices of surveillance detection can be found in these articles: ["How to Tell If You’re Being Followed,"](https://brandon-gregg.medium.com/how-to-tell-if-youre-being-followed-3707086fc2ac),
["How To Detect if You’re Under Surveillance,"](https://protectioncircle.org/2016/05/25/surveillance-detection-on-yourself/), ["Surveillance Detection: You Can’t Find Surveillance Unless You’re Looking For It."](https://ontic.co/blog/surveillance-detection-you-cant-find-surveillance-unless-youre-looking-for-it/).

**TailDetector** lets you draw a surveillance detection route that goes through three or more detection zones. Each zone is surrounded by a circle with a configured radius. The system algorithm processes the recognized vehicles only within the detection zones. For more detailed description, see [iOS Application](#td-application)

The system consists of three major components:
* Four [Cameras](#cameras) installed inside a vehicle (one front camera and three more on the rear of the vehicle).
* A [Single-Board Computer](#single-board-computer) with high GPU capabilities enabling complex AI operations for automated license plate recognition.
* An [iOS Application](#ios-application) for drawing the SDR, controlling the single-board computer and getting alerts in case of detected surveillance ("Tails").


## Cameras
I'm using Basler dart cameras (daA1280-54uc) with USB 3.0 interface. 
[Basler](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/vision-campus/interfaces-and-standards/usb3-interface-future/), refers to the bandwidth volume of the USB 3.0 vision interface as 350 MB/s. Although less than the formal speed of USB 3.0 interface (maybe due to encoding overhead), this speed is suitable for our scenario. Wiring inside a vehicle doesn't require more than 8m cable length (also supported by this interface). 

## Single-Board Computer
Nvidia produces popular developer kits suitable for tasks like this. I'm using the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit. Xavier NX has impressive GPU features: 384 CUDA cores + 48 Tensor cores Volta GPU, 21 TOPS. There are 4 USB 3.0 ports on board. For more details, go to [Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit).

This single-board computer is actually the core of the system. This component manages the following:
* Transferring the streamed video into a "lecense plate recognition" service via GStreamer pipelines.
* Automates the license plate recognition using [Rekor Scout agent](https://www.openalpr.com/software/scout). 
* Mediation subsystem (python process) that orchestrates and mediates between all subsystems on the single-board computer: cameras functionality, daemons, two-way communication with iOS application via [peertalk protocol implementaion](#peertalk-protocol-implementation), etc.
* Multiplexing connections (to external iOS device) over USB using [USBMUXD](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd) daemon. 


## iOS Application
The iOS application is the front of the system. It draws the detection routes, starts the surveillance detection phase, and finally, creates corresponding alerts. The iOS application communicates with the Jetson Xavier via the USBMUXD daemon. Although wireless interfaces (for example, Wi-Fi) for such communication can be simpler and more intuitive, I chose to implement all iOS-Jetson communication using PeerTalk over a USB connection (that is, a "closed system"). This choice can be considered one more step toward reducing possible attack surface. There is at least one downside to this: the iOS device must be connected to the Jetson during the detection phase.

# General scheme of the system

## An overview of how the system works

1. Turning on the Jetson Xavier NX activates two services. One service is responsible for running the Mediation subsystem (by calling `python3 ~/TailDetector/Mediation/usb_listener.py`). 
The second service is responsible for creating v4l2loop devices.
2. The Mediation subsystem monitors USB device insertion. When the `add` action is detected, Mediation will check if `usbmuxd.service` is running. 
If it is in a "running" state, it signifies that the iOS device is inserted into a USB port.
3. The Mediation establishes two PeerTalk channels for bidirectional communication with the iOS application: One channel receives the commands (sends replies accordingly) from the iOS application; A second channel transfers the information produced by the Rekor Scout agent (recognized vehicle and license plate data are written to a Beanstalk queue).
4. After establishing these two communication channels, the Mediation loops to drain from a Beanstalk queue. When the system starts, the Rekor Scout agent is not yet active. In this case, the queue is empty and there are no entries to drain.
5. When starting the Rekor Scout agent (by receiving a specific command from the iOS application), the agent receives streams of video from all cameras. During processing, the agent writes entries to a Beanstalk queue. Each entry contains information (in JSON format) about a recognized vehicle (includes license plate and vehicle images).
6. The Mediation tries to drain entries from the queue. When it encounters an entry, it sends the JSON object (in string format) to the iOS application via the peertalk channel.
7. How are the cameras installed in the car? One Basler dart camera (with Arducam CS-Mount Lens, 8mm Focal Length) is located at the front of the car, adjusted to 61 degrees approximately. This camera is crucial for capturing overtaking vehicles. Two other cameras, with the same specifications (with Arducam CS-Mount Lens, 12mm Focal Length), are located at the rear side of the vehicle, adjusted to 56 degrees each. Finally, the fourth camera (Arducam CS-Mount Lens, 35mm Focal Length) is located between the two rear cameras. This camera is responsible for capturing license plates of vehicles that keep distance from the recognized vehicle. I managed to capture license plates from approximately 50–60 meters with this camera (35mm Focal Length) and from approximately 80m (using 50mm Focal Length). When using the Basler dart model puA1280-54uc: for Focal Length of *35mm* and working distance of *60m*, object width is **8224mm** (using Basler [lens selector tool](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/tools/lens-selector/#camera-series=s-2072;camera-model=m-8131)). 
License plates' width in Israel is around **470mm** approximately.
According to [Rekor Scout](https://docs.rekor.ai/camera-configuration/camera-placement-guide/pixels-on-target) documentation: "Our software reads USA plates wider than 75 pixels and European plates wider than 90 pixels."
Using these specifications, we can calculate the number of pixels that "covers" the license plate: *horizontal resolution / (object width / license plate width)*  = 1280 / (8224/470) = 73 pixels.

9. Two processes (using Pylon API) are responsible for grabbing frames from the cameras.
[RegularGrab](Pylon/SingleCamera/RegularGrab.cpp) grabs frames from a given single camera for preview purposes, while [Grab_MultipleCameras](Pylon/MultipleCameras/Grab_MultipleCameras.cpp) grabs frames from all cameras. Each process, when invoked, grabs frames and writes them to a v4l2loopback device (e.g. `/dev/video0`).
10. These v4l2loop video devices are the same ones from which the Rekor Scout agent receives video stream (using the preconfigured GStreamer pipeline).
11. Prior to activating the system, it is recommended to calibrate the cameras. TailDetector supports camera preview. Grabbed video frames from a specific camera are sent to the iOS device via a designated PeerTalk channel. It is a video channel implemented within the Mediation subsystem.

## PeerTalk Protocol Implementation
Seeking for secured **wired** communication between the iOS application and the core of the system (the Jetson Xavier), I encountered a pretty simple solution: USBMUXD and PeerTalk.

For the core system (Jetson), I extended the usbmux python script of [Hector Martin "marcan"](https://code.google.com/archive/p/iphone-dataprotection/source/default/source) to support three different channels of communication between two devices (iOS device and Linux device):
* Command - The iOS Application sends control messages directed to the Mediation subsystem on the Jetson device. The Mediation subsystem performs the received command and sends a corresponding response.
* Video - The iOS Application receives a stream of video frames from a selected single camera using the Mediation subsystem as a mediator. This feature enables camera preview prior to the detection phase. 
* Vehicle - Each vehicle recognition data produced by the Rekor Scout agent is encapsulated using the Mediation subsystem that sends it to the iOS application for further processing. 

  [David House's](https://github.com/davidahouse/peertalk-python) script example was helpful in demonstrating how to create a communication channel using Marcan's usbmux implementation. 
Finally, in order to implement these three channels in Swift code (on iOS device), I use [Rasmus Andersson's](https://github.com/rsms/peertalk) implementation of Cocoa library for communicating over USB. 
I also extended his PTChannelDelegate to support the three PeerTalk channels mentioned. 

# Installation Guide (Jetson Xavier NX)

## Pylon Camera Software Suite
Working with [Basler cameras](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/embedded-vision/embedded-vision-portfolio/embedded-vision-cameras/) requires Pylon software. In this project I created two utilities using pylon c++ API. Pylon also support python (pypylon), but I have found it more convenient to use their c++ API. 
These two utilities are responsible for frame grabbing: [RegularGrab](Pylon/SingleCamera/RegularGrab.cpp) grabs frames from a given camera (using camera serial number as an argument), manipulate the grabbed frames, and finally writes frames into v4l2 loop device (/dev/video device); 
[Grab_MultipleCameras](Pylon/MultipleCameras/Grab_MultipleCameras.cpp) get a list of pairs (camera serial number, video loop device). It grabs frames from all cameras and writes frames to the corresponding video loop device.  
Software suite for Linux x86 (64 Bit) can be found here: [pylon 6.2.0 Camera Software Suite](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/software-pylon-6-3-0-linux-x86-64bit/). Pylon default installation folder is `/opt/pylon`. Along C/C++ code samples, Pylon provides very useful utility for cameras viewing, capturing and configuring: `/etc/pylon/bin/pylonviewer`.  

## V4l2loopback
To stream all grabbed frames from cameras to the OpenALPR (Rekor Scout) daemon (requires using GStreamer pipeline), we need to use v4l2 loopback devices.
Installation instruction can be found here [v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback).
In the case of four cameras, I submit this simple line after installation is finished.

    # modprobe v4l2loopback devices=4

Check that four devices have been created

## USBMUXD
See [libimobiledevice](https://libimobiledevice.org/), a cross-platform library to communicate with iOS devices natively.
Plug your iOS device and perform a simple check to ensure installation:
~~~
# ideviceinfo -k ProductVersion
15.3.1
~~~~

## Startup services
Naturally, TailDetector is designed to operate as a headless system. To support this the system (the Jetson) must initiate itself and communicate with attached iOS devices. 
Two services exist for this task:

### [usb_listener.service](Startup/usb_listener.service)
This service is responsible for restarting the Mediation subsystem every time the Jetson turns on.

~~~
# usb_listener.service
[Unit]
Description=Start usb_listener.py

...

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/jetty/TailDetector/Mediation
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 usb_listener.py
StandardInput=tty-force
Restart=on-failure

...
~~~~

The file should be copied to `/lib/systemd/system`. After copying, run the following lines:

    # systemctl status usb_listener.service
    # systemctl enable usb_listener.service
    # systemctl start usb_listener.service

### [video_capture.service](Startup/video_capture.service)
This service is responsible for two operations:
* Creating four v4l2 loop devices during Jetson Bootstrap.
* Redefining how much USB-FS memory is needed. For Basler cameras the process of acquiring an image is divided into three steps: Image acquisition by the camera hardware; Data transfer in which the computer receives the collected information; Image grabbing by the pylon application. USB-FS memory stores each image transferred from the camera to the computer. The kernel memory allocated for usage with USB on a typical 64-bit Ubuntu system is 16MB. This memory size should be redetermined as follows: number of buffers (the maximum frame rate of the camera) * camera Resolution * bit-depth * number of cameras. For example: 4 dart cameras (1280 X 720), RGB with 8 bit pixel format, 54 fps. usbfs_memory_mb = 4 * (1280*720) * 3 * 8 * 54 =~ 600MB. In case of memory shortage, 22 fps are sufficient; hence usbfs_memory_mb can be defined to 256MB.  

~~~
# video_capture.service
[Unit]
Description=Create /dev/video* entries and define usbfs_memory

...

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStartPre=/sbin/modprobe videodev
ExecStart=/sbin/insmod ~/v4l2loopback/v4l2loopback.ko devices=4
ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c 'echo 256 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'

## OpenALPR Rekor Scout agent
Rekor Scout is a commercial Vehicle Recognition Platform. It suited my Proof Of Concept objectives. Installation instructions can be found here: [Install Scout Agent](https://docs.rekor.ai/getting-started/rekor-scout-quick-start/install-scout-agent). 
I tested the agent on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, and on Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX and nano. The Jetson family is a good choice as a host due to NVIDIA GPU hardware. The Rekor Scout Agent's performance can be accelerated by the GPU hardware. For this purpose Rekor maintains special binaries to work directly with NVIDIA GPUs.
### Configurations

Rekor Scout agent uses miscellaneous configuration files. 

#### alprd.conf
The primary configuration file for the Scout Agent is located in `/etc/openalpr/alprd.conf` file.
On the Jetson Xavier NX I added these changes to override defaults:
~~~
# Each thread consumes an entire CPU core. Jetson Xavier has 6 cores.
analysis_threads = 6

# Start the agent via the iOS application and not automatically at the Jetson Boot.
auto_start_on_boot = 0

# Scout automatically classifies vehicle make/model, color, and body type for each license plate group it detects.
classify_vehicles = 1 

# Every country uses a different format and size of number plate.
country = il

# Improves efficiency. The ALPR processing only analyzes frames with movement, ignoring areas of the image that have not changed.
motion_detection = 1 

motion_stickiness = 10
parked_car_max_delta_ms = 1000

# Groups similar plate numbers together in one JSON unit. 
plate_groups_min_plates_to_group = 1
plate_groups_time_delta_ms = 1000

# Disable storing data on host
store_plates = 0
store_plates_maxsize_mb = 0
store_video = 0
store_video_maxsize_gb = 0

# Disable data uploading 
upload_data = 0
store_plates_maxsize_gb = 0
~~~~

#### Camera configuration file

The agent must be configured to connect to one or more camera streams to process license plates. Each camera requires its configuration file in the folder `/etc/openalpr/stream.d/`.   
For example, if we use two cameras, two configuration files are needed:
~~~
# /etc/openalpr/stream.d/dart0.conf
stream = dart0
camera_id = 0
gstreamer_format = v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,format=RGB ! videoconvert ! 
  videorate ! video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,width=1280,height=720 ! appsink name=sink max-buffers=10
~~~~

~~~
# /etc/openalpr/stream.d/dart1.conf
stream = dart1
camera_id = 1
gstreamer_format = v4l2src device=/dev/video1 ! video/x-raw,format=RGB ! videoconvert ! 
  videorate ! video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,width=1280,height=720 ! appsink name=sink max-buffers=10
~~~~

Each video source (such as camera, video file) needs to be configured. In this Proof of Concept, the GStreamer pipeline is arranged to handle pulling video from a specific /dev/video device, to which image frames from [RegularGrab](Pylon/SingleCamera/RegularGrab.cpp) and from [Grab_MultipleCameras](Pylon/MultipleCameras/Grab_MultipleCameras.cpp) are written.
Each license plate recognized and processed by Rekor Scout is displayed in the iOS application in a small frame in the upper left corner. This feature is useful in two aspects: It indicates that all cameras are involved in video capturing. It also serves as the system's sign of life indicator. Using ***camera_id*** key-value in each camera configuration maintains a b-directional reference mechanism between the iOS application and the Jetson. This mechanism helps identify which camera captured the processed license plate.

</p>


#### Integration with Rekor Scout Agent

I prefer to integrate with the Rekor Scout Agent "on-premises" and offline. Rekor Scout supports this configuration by storing data locally in a beanstalkd queue. The Mediation subsystem within Jetson grabs and processes the latest plate results within this queue. To enable storing data in a queue add `use_beanstalkd = 1` to `alprd.conf`. This can be done also using the alprdconfig gui: 
<p align="center">
  <img src="readme/data_configuration.png" width="600" title="Data Configuration">
</p>

#### alpr.log
After activating the agent, messages concerning camera connection and behavior can be found in the log file `/var/log/alpr.log`. Here you can ensure that the custom GStreamer pipeline is recognized and valid. 
~~~

## Miscellaneous scripts 

* [start_single_cam.sh](Mediation/start_single_cam.sh) - Responsible for starting and stopping a single camera for preview purposes by invoking RegularGrab.
* [start_daemons.sh](Mediation/start_daemons.sh) - Responsible for starting the Rekor Scout daemon and also for starting and stopping all cameras by invoking Grab_MultipleCameras.  

These scripts are called by the Mediation subsystem when the TD application sends  an appropriate command. The Mediation subsystem (for example, python script) calls these scripts with `sudo`. For that to work we need to edit `/etc/sudoers` using `visudo` and add these lines:

~~~
# user is jetty
jetty ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /home/jetty/Mediation/start_daemons.sh
jetty ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /home/jetty/Mediation/start_single_cam.sh
~~~


# TD Application

iOS Application has four main views:
* **Edit View** - In this view the user can draw a detection route by using long-press gestures to define detection zones. Through these detection zones the system draws a route (Surveillance Detection Route). It draws a circle with a pre-configured radius around each detection zone. The circle defines the zone where the system processes all recognized license plates and vehicles, using some algorithm to determine if any surveillance is detected. A single-tap gesture on a defined detection zone brings up a small menu with Replace/Remove options.
* **Detect View** - After defining at least three detection zones, the user can begin the detection process by pressing the Start button. All vehicle data that was processed at the starting zone (inside a preconfigured radius) is saved for later processing. During the detection phase the Jetson processes all captured vehicles. When inside the perimeter of a detection zone (for example, the violet circle), the recognized vehicles are treated by the detection algorithm. Inside these circles a violet frame appears around the license plate preview in the upper left corner of the screen. Outside these detection zones, the frame will have a gray color, meaning the algorithm is ignoring the recognized vehicles. The algorithm (actually a very naive one) is located in the app. If the application sees that the system catches the same vehicle in two different detection zones, it means a high likelihood of surveillance of the recognized vehicle.
Even if the Rekor Scout Agent could pick up a partial license plate number, the algorithm is designed to decide if this partial algorithm is a substring of an already recognized license plate. When a Detection event occurs, the application brings up a floating view of the vehicle's image and the other necessary metadata. The user can view a report to determine if the application truly detects surveillance. A map view provides the user with all the zones where the system has encountered this vehicle. To get an accurate results, the user must define an appropriate route for detection.
* **Report View** - In this view the user can view two lists of vehicles: Those with high probability of engaging in surveillance and those with a lower probability. Usually those with low probability are vehicles with partial license plate number that matches a substring of another vehicle license number.
* **Settings View** - This view contains a section to control the headless Jetson and a section to control some features of the application itself.
    * **Jetson Disconnected** - This toggle button is readonly from the user's point of view. When the user plugs the iOS device (USB cable) to the Jetson, a PeerTalk connection is established. The toggle button is turned on.
    * **Cameras View** - In this view the user can select an already defined camera, send a command to the Jetson (Mediation subsystem will invoke [RegularGrab](Pylon/SingleCamera/RegularGrab.cpp) process), and receive a stream of video from the selected camera. Camera View is disabled while ALPRDaemon is toggled up, and vice versa.
    * **Define Cameras** - In order to activate a connected camera, the user must define (only once) a camera (such as add serial number, define camera name).
    * **ALPRDaemon is Down** - This toggle button is readonly from the user's point of view. When on, it indicates that the application is receiving signals from the Jetson, reading that the daemon is up.
    * **Start All Daemons** - Turning on the toggle button sends a command to the Jetson, instructing the Mediation subsystem to start the Rekor Scout daemon. The Mediation also invokes the [Grab_MultipleCameras](Pylon/MultipleCameras/Grab_MultipleCameras.cpp) process to operate grabbing frames from all cameras and to write the grabbed frames to the corresponding video loop devices.
    * **Detect Radius** - The user can configure the Detection Radius of a detection zone (such as the violet circle on map). The vehicle recognition data is processed by the detection algorithm only inside this region.
    * **In Zone Radius** - This value helps the algorithm to mark when the vehicle reaches the current detection zone.
    * **Recency Filter** - In some cases the application receives multiple packets of data of the same vehicle within a very short interval. When turned on, the Recency filter filters packets of data of the same vehicle if the time interval between the two packets is less than 5 seconds or if the distance between the two locations, where captured, is less than 50 meters.
    * **Reset All Data** - Clears all saved detection routes, reports, and other stuff.
